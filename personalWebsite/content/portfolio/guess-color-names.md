    [Guess Color Names!](https://agustinramirodiaz.github.io/Guess-Color-Names/) is a hangman game for color names.
challenge: I got the inspiration when I was at a paint shop with my SO, reading
  through the names of the palette colors. If you are familiar with this palettes,
  you know how bizarre the names are, so I thought "Let's make a game about trying to guess them".

  
  The only thing left I needed to achieve it was a color names database.
solution: Researching on Internet, I came across 
  across [handpicked color names](https://github.com/meodai/color-names) and used their API. 
  I wanted the game to be avaiable for anyone to play in any device, so I made it web (hested on GitHub Pages). I used vanila JS, HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap) because I wanted to make it lightweight. Then I switched from the API to a local JS file for a better UX. 


  When it was finished, I played a bit incorporating [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) into the project just to try it out.
