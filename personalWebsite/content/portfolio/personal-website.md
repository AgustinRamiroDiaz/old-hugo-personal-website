client: Open Source
shortDescription: I took my CV to the next level with my own personal website.
challenge: I wanted to make a user-friendly webpage, with as little 
    friction as posible. I like Front-end development but it's not what I'm after in the long run, therefore I had to find a framework to ease my work.
solution: I researched various framworks, and opted for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in the interest of learning [Go](https://golang.org/) and following the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture. I followed the quick start guide, added a git submodule of the template and started working. A major improvement was automating the deployment process with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and now my website is hosted with GitHub pages.
