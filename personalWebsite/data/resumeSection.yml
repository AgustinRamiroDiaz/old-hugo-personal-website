      #### Artificial Intelligence

      I've always been curious about AI, so I took open courses from Stanford, MIT, OpenAI, FastAI 
      using Pytorch and TensorFlow on topics such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 
      I'm familiar with various architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformers, CNN, Generative Models such as VAE and GAN).
