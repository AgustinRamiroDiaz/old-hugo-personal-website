      #### Data Science member
      
      I had the incredible opportunity to work with a small and amazing team of data scientists, computer scientists and bioinformatics at [Héritas](https://heritas.com.ar/), a genetics based presicion medicine company. 
      

      Despite the name of the area and the specialties among the team, our responsibilites were many and diverse. We were like a swiss army knife, all tasks related to informatics were in our hands. That's why we were able to work with a lot of different technologies and languages such as: 
        * Dev Ops:
          * Docker
          * Server management (of our own servers with CentOS and Ubuntu)
          * Third party cloud service providers (Digital Ocean, Google Cloud)
        * Programming languages:
          * Bash for running scripts and pipelines
          * Python 
            * API connections 
              * We took advantage of JIRA's issues workflow and took it to its limits to manage our process workflow. 
            * Data analysis and manipulation
              * Pandas
              * Numpy
          * R 
            * Along with its web framework, Shiny
              * We built all our main web apps using Shiny
            * Data analysis and manipulation
              * RStudio
              * Shiny*
            * Many packages for data analysis such as purr, pelt, peshape. 
          * Latex and Markdown for writing and formatting documents
        * Non relational databases:
          * MongoDB
        * Bioinformatics data representation
          * bcl
          * fasta / fastq
          * bam / cram
          * vcf
        * Bioinformatics data processing manipulation
          * Multiple command tools to aid our propietary pipeline

      I also developed and matured other more broad capabilities 
        * I learned a lot about genomics and the standards for handling the digital data associated with it.
        * Since our area was in the middle of the production process, I had to interact with different teams to understand the different processes and the different roles they had.
        * I had to read and understand the documentation of the tools we used to process the data.
        * I was in charge of the evolutionary maintainance of our apps, which was a complex task that nourished me in the process of learning and understanding. This sparked my interest in the micro-services architecture pattern which I'm still studying.

      #### QWorld Global Quantum Programming Workshop | [QBronze](https://qworld.lu.lv/index.php/workshop-bronze/)

      Introductory level workshop series on the basics of quantum computing 
      and quantum programming using Jupyter notebooks.

      The Bronze has five main sections
        * Basics of classical systems (Probabilistic bits, coin-flipping, biased coins, probabilistic states, and probabilistic operators, correlation)
        * Basics of quantum systems (Quantum programs as circuits: registers, gates, measurements, execution, and reading the outcomes, quantum state and operators)
        * Quantum operators on a quantum bot
        * Entanglement and basics quantum protocols
        * Quantum search algorithm

      #### Artificial Intelligence

      I've always been curious about AI, so I took open courses from Stanford, MIT, OpenAI, FastAI 
      using Pytorch and TensorFlow on topics such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 
      I'm familiar with various architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformers, CNN, Generative Models such as VAE and GAN).

      #### Unity 3D

      Created a simple infinite runner game using the [Unity3d](https://unity.com/) engine with C#.
      I followed tutorials from [Brackeys](https://brackeys.com/) and [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/).
