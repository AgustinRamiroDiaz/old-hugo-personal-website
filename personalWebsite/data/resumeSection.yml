      #### Backend Software Developer at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

      I've worked on the backend team, developing a multi-service Helm chart using `Golang` and `Kubernetes`, and a CLI tool for interacting with the Okteto Platform.


      Our Backend API was made using GraphQL technology,


      In this time, I've learned a lot about Kubernetes in depth, by managing and creating resources such as CRDs, Operators, Controllers and Webhooks. 


      I've gotten to know better the container ecosystem by using `Docker` and `containerd` while working with `Buildkit` and `Kubernetes`.


      I've also become very proficient in Golang, and I've got to know multiple packages such as `client-go` and `cobra`.


      #### Platform Infrastructure at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

      Due to the demand of the team, I moved to the infrastructure team to help with the development of the SaaS platform. 


      We used `Terraform` and `Terraform Cloud` with a lot of custom pipelines done with GitOps.


      I've also became comfortable working with `Google Cloud Platform` services (where we had all our infra) and got to explore a bit of `AWS` and `Azure`.

      #### Data Science member at [Héritas](https://heritas.com.ar/)

      I had the incredible opportunity to work with a small and amazing team of data scientists, computer scientists and bioinformatics in a genetics based presicion medicine company. 


      Despite the name of the area and the specialties among the team, our responsibilites were many and diverse. We were like a swiss army knife, all tasks related to informatics were in our hands. That's why we were able to work with a lot of different technologies and languages such as: 
        * Sys Admin:
          * Docker
          * Server management (of our own servers with CentOS and Ubuntu)
          * Third party cloud service providers (Digital Ocean, Google Cloud)
        * Programming languages:
          * Bash for running scripts and pipelines
          * Python 
            * API connections 
              * We took advantage of JIRA's issues workflow and took it to its limits to manage our process workflow. 
            * Data analysis and manipulation with Pandas and Numpy
          * R along with its web framework, Shiny
              * We built all our main web apps using Shiny
              * Many packages for data analysis such as purr, pelt, peshape. 
          * Latex and Markdown for writing and formatting documents
        * Non relational databases:
          * MongoDB
        * Bioinformatics data representation
          * bcl, fasta/fastq, bam/cram, vcf
        * Bioinformatics data processing manipulation
          * Multiple command tools to aid our propietary pipeline

      I also developed and matured other more broad capabilities:
        * I learned a lot about genomics and the standards for handling the digital data associated with it.
        * Since our area was in the middle of the production process, I had to interact with different teams to understand the different processes and the different roles they had.
        * I had to read and understand the documentation of the tools we used to process the data.
        * I was in charge of the evolutionary maintainance of our apps, which was a complex task that nourished me in the process of learning and understanding. This sparked my interest in the micro-services architecture pattern which I'm still studying.

      #### Artificial Intelligence

      I've always been curious about AI, so I took open courses from Stanford, MIT, OpenAI, FastAI 
      using Pytorch and TensorFlow on topics such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 
      I'm familiar with various architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformers, CNN, Generative Models such as VAE and GAN).
