      #### Front-end Web Development 

      I started web development working with [Angular](https://angular.io/) (Typescript, JavaScript, HTML and CSS) 
      developing the Distribution Management System for Naturgy (MX) at SZICOM.
      
      
      Then I had an idea for a [game](https://agustinramirodiaz.github.io/Guess-Color-Names/) about guessing 
      color names which I developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS (with the help of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)).
      Once it was finished I played with it incorporating a bit of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to the project.


      At the time, my latest project is this personal website. I'm following the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture, 
      using [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the [CDN](https://jamstack.org/glossary/cdn/) and 
      [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as the [SSG](https://jamstack.org/glossary/ssg/).

      #### Back-end Web Development 

      I worked in back-end developing the Distribution Management System for Naturgy (MX) at SZICOM.
      We started the project from scratch:
        * Communicating with the client 
        * Database modeling and implementation
        * [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
          with Microsoft's [.Net Core](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core) framework.
      
      And ended up with the complete product.
